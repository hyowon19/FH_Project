# FH_Project

This project was done with the react library.  I used the create-react-app initializer created by FaceBook.

Please refer to https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.

If you have cloned it correctly, all you should need to do is get to the appropriate pathway of the project in your command line and then run 'npm start'.  The website should run on your localhost.

This project revolved around tinkering with the online API, http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.

Basic authentication, displaying lists of various content as well as filtering information specific to certain IDs, etc were done in this project.
